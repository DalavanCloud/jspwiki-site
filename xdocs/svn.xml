<section name="Source code access">

<p>You may access the Apache JSPWiki source code from the Apache SVN.</p>

<p>The repository address for read-only access is:
</p>
<pre>
  <a class="external" href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/" rel="nofollow">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/</a>
</pre>
<p>The repository address for people with commit access is:
</p>
<pre>
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/
</pre>
<p>It is strongly recommended you only check out the trunk or the tag you're interested in:
</p>
<pre>
  &gt; svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/trunk JSPWiki
</pre>

<p>You can use this url in a web-browser to see what subdirectories are available 
before choosing one to actually check out.
</p>

</section>
<section name="Branches">

<p>JSPWiki branches are named in ALL CAPS, and are named <tt>JSPWIKI_X_Y_BRANCH</tt>.  Whenever
a stable release is cut, the code is branched and named accordingly. For example, you may
access the JSPWiki 2.8 code branch from</p>
<pre>
 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/branches/JSPWIKI_2_8_BRANCH/
</pre>
<p>Future stable releases are then cut from the stable branch, and have an increasing minor revision
(e.g. 2.8.1, 2.8.2, etc).</p>
</section>

<section name="Tags">

<p>Similarly, all releases are tagged when made.  The naming convention is simple: jspwiki_x_y_z_n,
where x,y and z are revision numbers, and n is a release designator (alpha,beta,incubating).
For example, you may check out the 2.8.2 stable release by using the following URL:</p>
<pre>
 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/tags/jspwiki_2_8_2/
</pre>
    
</section>

<section name="European mirror">
<p>If you are located in Europe, you are highly encouraged to use the European mirror,
as this will lower the load on the US server, and will also be considerably faster for you.
</p>
<p>The mirror is synced every few minutes, so in practice you won't see a difference 
in the repository contents. The only time this might be a problem is if you do an 
"svn update" right after an "svn commit", but a better workflow would be to update 
before committing.
</p>
<p>So, you can also grab code from svn repo also from: 
</p>
<pre>http://svn.eu.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/
</pre> 
<p>or (people with commit access):</p>
<pre>https://svn.eu.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/
</pre>
