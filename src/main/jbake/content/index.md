## Welcome to Apache JSPWiki

[Apache JSPWiki][] is a leading open source [WikiWiki][] engine, feature-rich and built around standard [JEE][] components (Java, servlets, JSP). 

Some of its features include:

  * WikiMarkup/Structured Text
  * File attachments 
  * Templates support
  * Data storage through your choice of two [WikiPage Providers][], with the capability to create and plug in new ones
  * [Security][]: fine grained control over authorization and authentication, yet simple to configure
  * Easy [plugin][] and [page filter][] interfaces
  * UTF-8 support
  * JSP-based
  * Easy-ish [installation][]
  * Page locking to prevent editing conflicts
  * Support for Multiple Wikis
  * [Custom User Preferences][]

You can see who is using [JSPWiki today][], and the [WikiMatrix][] page shows you a comparison with other wiki's.

JSPWiki is open-source software that is released under the Apache Public License. [https://jspwiki-wiki.apache.org]() serves as the platform for project collaboration. The JSPWiki community welcomes any help with the project. You don't need to be a software developer to get involved -- there are many other ways to contribute.
