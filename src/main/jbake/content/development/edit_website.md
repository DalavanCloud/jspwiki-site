Apache JSPWiki website
----------------------

(adapted from [Apache Guacamole site](https://github.com/apache/incubator-guacamole-website))

[This repository](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=jspwiki-site.git) contains the source for the website of Apache JSPWiki, so it can be deployed via [gitpubsub](https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/git_based_websites_available).

The website itself is completely static, being automatically generated by [JBake](https://jbake.org/) prior to deployment. The content 
of the website is written in a mixture of Freemarker templates and Markdown. Templated content is interpreted only 
at build time, with the final result being completely static.

To facilitate ease of development and testing, this repository also contains a couple of build scripts, `ci.sh` 
and `mvn-ci.sh`, the usage of which is documented below.

## Repository structure<a name="repository-structure"></a>

In addition to the `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files required of any proper Apache-licensed project, 
the repository contains the following critical files:

* **`./pom.xml`**: orchestrates the maven website build
* **`./ci.sh`**: script, meant to be run by a CI server, to build and deploy the website.
* **`./mvn-ci.sh`**: script to build and deploy the website using Maven.
* **`./src/main/jbake/`**: standard [jbake maven plugin structure](https://github.com/ingenieux/jbake-maven-plugin), contains three subdirectories:
    * `./src/main/jbake/assets/`: The assets directory is where you should place your static files such as images, 
    CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. These files are copied over to the baked output as is. You can create any 
    directory structure you like in the assets directory and this structure will be maintained when copied.
    * `./src/main/jbake/content/`: holds content files, with the extension of these files determining what 
    type of content it contains (i.e.: `.md` for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), `.html` for raw HTML, etc.)
    * `./src/main/jbake/templates/`: holds templates files, with the extension of these files determining 
    the templates engine (i.e.: `.ftl` for [Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/), `.thyme` for [Thymeleaf](http://www.thymeleaf.org/), etc.)
* **`./content/`**: the actual content served for jspwiki.apache.org, see [publishing changes](#publishing-changes) below

## Build prerequisites<a name="build-prerequisites"></a>

The CI build (`ci.sh`) needs Java 7 and a JBake installation under `$JBAKE_HOME`. This script is run at [ASF's Jenkins instance](https://builds.apache.org/job/jspwiki-site/). 
As there isn't a Maven installation at the nodes which perform this job, this script only takes the changes from the "jbake" branch, 
generates the site and puts it on the "asf-site" branch. As for now, javadocs must be pushed locally through the Maven build script.

The Maven build (`mvn-ci.sh`) needs at least Maven 3.1.1 and Java 7, thus these must be installed first. It's essentially the 
same build as the CI build, but done through Maven. This allows us to generate the site and also put the javadocs in there.

## Testing changes locally<a name="testing-changes-locally"></a>

Just run `mvn clean jbake:inline` and the site will be accesible through http://localhost:8080. Changes will be reloaded 
on the fly. When done testing your local changes, press `Enter` to stop the web server and return to the shell.

In order to be able to navigate locally, you'll need to edit the `site.host` property at `./src/main/jbake/jbake.properties`.
Do **NOT** commit that change.

## Publishing changes<a name="publishing-changes"></a>

Changes to the website are published using Apache's [gitpubsub](https://blogs.apache.org/infra/entry/git_based_websites_available) which relies on a 
special branch called "asf-site" containing *all website content*.

In the Apache JSPWiki website repository, the "asf-site" branch is an "orphan" branch. Updating the website thus involves:

1. Making and testing your changes locally
2. Replacing the entire contents within "asf-site" with the newly-generated site from the "jbake" branch.

Second step is automated through `ci.sh` and `mvn-ci.sh` scripts. 

Keep in mind that the new content must be *staged* for and committed in this branch. Once you have verified that the staged 
content is as expected, commit your changes (along with a useful commit message describing the changes at a high level) 
using `git commit` and publish the update using `git push origin`.

If you wish to unstage your changes, use `git reset --hard HEAD` to return to the original state of "jbake", wiping 
out any local modifications. You can then return to whichever branch you were working on with `git checkout`.
